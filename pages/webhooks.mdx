# Webhook Implementation Guide

This document provides details about the webhook system implementation in ARP Digital GPS.

## Overview

The webhook system sends real-time notifications to user-configured endpoints when specific events occur in the platform. This allows clients to stay updated on transaction status changes and other important events without polling the API.
Here is a demo video showing how to test the Webhook API:

## Webhook Creation Steps

Follow these steps to create and configure a webhook for receiving real-time notifications.

1. Login to your ARP Digital account.
2. Navigate to the Webhooks section from Sidebar.
3. Click on button **Create Webhook**.
4. Enter the following details:
   - **URL**: The endpoint where you want to receive webhook notifications.
   - **Description(Optional)**: A brief description of the webhook's purpose.
   - **Payload Version**: Select the payload version (e.g., v1(Legacy), v2(Recommended)).
   - **Events to Subscribe**: Select the events you want to subscribe (e.g. wallet.deposit.completed, otc.trade.created).
5. Click "Create Webhook" to save the webhook configuration.
6. Test the webhook by performing actions that trigger the subscribed events.
7. Monitor your endpoint to ensure it receives and processes the webhook payloads correctly.
8. You can view details, edit, send test or delete your webhooks from the Webhooks section.
9. Ensure your endpoint responds with a `200 OK` status to acknowledge receipt of the webhook.
10. Implement security measures such as signature verification to validate incoming webhooks.
11. Monitor webhook delivery status and logs for troubleshooting.
12. Regularly review and update your webhook configurations as needed.

{/* ## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint        | Description                              | Response                                  |
| ------ | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/webhooks`     | List all webhooks for authenticated user | Array of webhook objects without secrets  |
| POST   | `/webhooks`     | Create a new webhook with URL            | Webhook object including generated secret |
| DELETE | `/webhooks/:id` | Delete a webhook by ID                   | Success confirmation                      |

The webhook object structure:

```json
{
  "id": "webhook_uuid",
  "url": "https://your-endpoint.com/webhook",
  "secret": "32bytesecretinhexformat", // Only included in create response
  "isActive": true,
  "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:01Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:01Z"
}
```

## Webhook Payload Structure

All webhooks send a consistent JSON payload:

```json
description:"Webhook for transaction completed"
events:["gps.transaction.completed"]
url:"https://platform.arpdigital.io"
version:2
```

## Security

### Signature Verification

Each webhook includes security headers:

- `X-API-Key` : Your unique API Key
- `X-Timestamp` : The current Unix timestamp in milliseconds
- `X-Signature` : HMAC SHA256 signature of the payload
- `X-Environment` : Specifies the environment `sandbox` or `production`

### Signature Generation

```javascript
const signature = crypto
  .createHmac("sha256", webhook_secret)
  .update(JSON.stringify(payload))
  .digest("hex");
```

### Verification Example

```javascript
function verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest("hex");

  return signature === expectedSignature;
}
```

### Webhook Delivery

Webhooks are delivered using HTTP POST requests with the following characteristics:

- JSON payload in the request body
- Standard headers including content-type, webhook signature, event type, and webhook ID
- Requests are made using the internal `fetcher` utility that handles HTTP requests
- Responses are logged but don't affect the transaction flow

```javascript
// Example of webhook request sent
const response = await fetcher(webhook.url, {
  method: "POST",
  data: payload,
  headers: {
  "X-API-Key: <your_api_key_here>"
  "X-Timestamp: <current_timestamp_in_millis>"
  "X-Signature: <your_signature_key_here>"
  "X-Environment: sandbox or production"
  },
});

```

## Webhook Response Requirements

When your endpoint receives a webhook, it should:

1. **Verify the signature** using the steps outlined in the Security section
2. **Process the webhook data** according to your application's needs
3. **Respond with:**
   - HTTP status code `200 OK` to acknowledge receipt
   - Content-Type header set to `application/json`
   - A JSON response body (can be a simple confirmation like `{"received": true}`)

Example response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "received": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-07-09T14:23:45Z"
}
```

Failure to respond properly may result in delivery retries or other issues in future versions of the API. \*/}
